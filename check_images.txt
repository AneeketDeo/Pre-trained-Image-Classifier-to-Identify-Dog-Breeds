Answer: Yes


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: ResNet did a pretty good job at classifying the 4 uploaded images.
One big difference I witnessed between the 3 models was that ResNet identified the Animal I uploaded (Which was a white rabbit) correctly while the rest couldn't (both vgg and AlexNet identified it as Wallaby, brush kangaroo)
